	================================ Spring Data ==============================================
	
 Q. What is Persistence ?
 A. Persistence means Storage. The place where we are going to store data are called Persistence Store.
 
	Persistence Operations:
		1. Insert
		2. Update
		3. Delete
		4. Retrieve
	Persistence technologies:
	-> Used to develop persistence logic
	-> Persistence logic is used to perform persistence operations in persistence store.
	-> There are several tech to develop persistence logic
		1. Java JDBC
		2. Spring JDBC
		3. ORM frameworks
		4. Spring Data etc...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Best practices to develop persistence logic
	
	-> We should maintain persistence logic as separate layer (DAO or Repository)
	-> In persistence logic we follow Table per DAO concept -(One table , one dao) => Single responsibility principle
	-> Table name, column name, sequences names has the lenght liitaions of 30 characters, otherwise ignore vowels.
	-> For every table atleast one primary key is recommended.
	-> For every table Auditing columns are recommneded :
	`		CREATED_BY
			CREATED_DATE
			UPDATED_BY
			UPDATED_DATE
	-> For every primary key create a dedicated sequences to generate primary key columns.
	-> Always maintain cahche for static table data to avoid DB interactions.(https://chat.openai.com/share/3475072f-a85b-4108-a520-8fa8e2040ec3)



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	We will use the DB as the persistence store:
	
	DB installation :
		1. DB server
		2. DB client (Installed by developers in company)
	
-> In company, DB server will be install by DB admin in remote machines
-> After installing DB server, DB team wil share DB details to team
-> Developers and Testers will install DB Client Software in their amchines.


*** TO AVOID BIOLERPLATE CODE IN DAO LAYER SPRING DATA CAME INTO PICTURE .
-> No methods are required to perform CRUD operations.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Spring DATA provide 2 repository interfaces:
	1. Crudrespository -provide methods to perform crud operations
	2. JpaRepository - provide methods to perform crud operations + pagination + sorting
